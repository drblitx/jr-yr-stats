# üèê Junior Year Volleyball Stats (jr-yr-stats)

A personal data project analyzing my performance in high school volleyball across three seasons:
- **Freshman (2016)**
- **Sophomore (2017)**
- **Senior (2019)**

Then uses these analyses to predict what my stats would have been match-by-match and season during my junior year (see `junior_full.csv` for what I mean). My junior year was under-reported; so I'm using data science to estimate what should've been.

This project compiles and cleans individual match-level statistics from each season, producing a dataset that supports analysis. Examples include trends, situational performance, and match outcomes. The final dataset is saved as `all_seasons.csv`.
