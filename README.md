# üèê HS Volleyball Stats (jr-yr-stats)

This is a personal data project analyzing my performance in high school volleyball across 3 seasons:
- **Freshman (2016)**
- **Sophomore (2017)**
- **Senior (2019)**

My junior season (2018) was not per-match-tracked for statistics due to poor record-keeping. There's the schedule and results, but not the stats. Hence, this project will use data science to estimate what my match-by-match and season-long stas would've been based on past performance (see junior_full.csv). 

This project compiles and cleans individual match-level statistics from each season, which produces a dataset that supports analysis of trends, performance, and outcomes of matches. The final merged dataset is saved as PLACEHOLDER csv.
