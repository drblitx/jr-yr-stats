I did start, but it got pretty messy in the merging of things, so can we start "over" in terms of setting things up cleanly 
so I can merge things clearly and without issues (as there are several occurrences where I will play against the same team 
twice on the same day which could cause joining errors)

I'm building a personal data project analyzing my performance in high school volleyball across three seasons:
Freshman (2016), Sophomore (2017), Senior (2019)
Then uses these analyses to predict what my stats would have been match-by-match and season during my junior year
(see junior_full.csv for what I mean). My junior year was not tracked due to bad coaches (I have the schedules & results though);
so I'm using data science to estimate what should've been.

This project compiles and cleans individual match-level statistics from each season, producing a dataset that supports analysis. 
Examples include trends, situational performance, and match outcomes. Here's some examples of the columns I'll have

🧍‍♀️ Personal + Participation Flags
