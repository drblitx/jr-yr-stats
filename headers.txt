I did start, but it got pretty messy in the merging of things, so can we start "over" in terms of setting things up cleanly 
so I can merge things clearly and without issues (as there are several occurrences where I will play against the same team 
twice on the same day which could cause joining errors)

I'm building a personal data project analyzing my performance in high school volleyball across three seasons:
Freshman (2016)
Sophomore (2017)
Senior (2019)
Then uses these analyses to predict what my stats would have been match-by-match and season during my junior year
(see junior_full.csv for what I mean). My junior year was not tracked due to bad coaches (I have the schedules & results though);
so I'm using data science to estimate what should've been.

This project compiles and cleans individual match-level statistics from each season, producing a dataset that supports analysis. 
Examples include trends, situational performance, and match outcomes. Here's some examples of the columns I'll have

I'd like to add a set to set array (i.e., ['W','W','L','W']),and the sets won/lost cols.

and more context behind the tags
🧍‍♀️ Personal + Participation Flags:

did_play → True/False based on stats row existing.
injured → manually set; True for missed games (esp. during non-sophomore years).
forfeited → if opponent forfeited (you mentioned NA in result).
played_all_sets → sets_played == set_count
is_repeat_opponent → if faced the same opponent more than once in the same season
milestone_flag → values like:
'first_match'
'first_tournament'
'100th_kill'
'last_match'
🏷️ Match Context Tags:

match_type → one of:
'regular', 'tournament_pool', 'tournament_bracket', 'playoff', 'championship', 'forfeit', 'injured'
game_importance → categorical: 'low', 'normal', 'high'
game_importance_score → numeric: 0 (regular), 1 (tournament), 2 (playoffs), maybe 3 (championship)?
highlight_match → is_highlight, default to False, you edit manually
comeback_win → lost 1st set but won match
rivalry → set manually (optional: you can specify list later)
📊 Stats-Based Calculations:

personal_performance_score → weighted:
= (kills * 1.5 + assists * 1.2 + aces * 1.0 + digs * 0.8 + blocks * 1.3 - kill_err * 0.5 - serve_err * 0.4)
personal_performance_per_set → score ÷ sets played
🧮 Match Context / Timeline Features:

match_index → per season (you already have this)
career_match_index → overall running index
week_of_season → week number (offset from first match)
season_stage → early / mid / late based on match index
win_streak / loss_streak → rolling counts
days_since_last_match → from previous match
fatigue_factor → sets played the day before / 5.0
🎂 Date & Opponent Details:

birthday_match → if match falls on 10-03
opponent_category → One of:
'conference', 'deaf school', 'private', 'public', 'out of state', 'unknown'
total_points_for / total_points_against → from set_scores (sum of your/team points vs opponent)

💥 Performance Dynamics
best_match_of_season: Boolean flag — your highest personal_performance_score in that season.
season_performance_percentile: Rank each match by percentile of your performance within the season (helps ID "top 10%" games).
clutch_factor: Combine personal_performance_score * game_importance_score — shows how well you performed in big games.
📉 Consistency + Slumps
below_avg_performance: Flag if your score is >1 std dev below your season average.
performance_trend: Add a rolling average of performance over last 3 matches — could be useful for visualizing form.
📆 Match Frequency Context
is_back_to_back: True if played the day after another match.
multi_game_day: Flag if multiple matches happened on the same date (useful for tournaments).
first_match_of_day / last_match_of_day if more than one on the same date.
🧠 Psychology / Emotion-Inspired
revenge_match: Faced a team you lost to earlier that season.
confidence_boost_game: After a losing streak, this match started a winning streak.
🏅 Career Milestone Bonus Tags (more granular)
first_kill, first_ace, first_blk → might be available if you want to track raw accumulation.
season_total_kills (after aggregation) → so each row shows your cumulative kills up to that point.

🎯 Match Role & Situation
was_set_swept: True if you lost in straight sets (e.g. 0–2, 0–3).
swept_opponent: True if you won in straight sets.
deciding_set_played: Flag if the match went to final deciding set (e.g. 5th in best-of-5 or 3rd in best-of-3). (this has to be manual because some tournaments had weird formats)
total_sets_that_day: Aggregate number of sets played on that day (sum across matches with same date).
match_order_that_day: If multiple matches on same day, track if it was 1st, 2nd, etc.
match_density_3days: Number of matches played in last 3 days — good proxy for tight scheduling.

🔧 Performance Variants
offensive_focus_score: kills + aces + hit_pct + serve_pct
(emphasizes offensive load even if assists/digs aren't high).
defensive_impact_score: digs + total_blks + receiving
(separate from your offensive rating).
efficiency_score:
Normalize performance per attack/serve attempts to see how efficient you were.
zero_stat_match: True if all stat categories (kills, digs, etc.) are 0 — useful for DNP detection.

🧱 Team Context (Optional if data exists or can be faked)
team_needed_win: After 2+ losses, this match could’ve been important to bounce back.
high_margin_win: Team won with margin_pct > 0.6.
low_margin_loss: Lost by only 1 set or margin_pct < 0.1.

🧠 Cognitive Tags
opponent_strength_tier: If available, rate opponents as "high/mid/low" strength based on your win/loss history against them or external source (like MaxPreps rank).
predictable_match: Win/loss outcome matches historical performance vs opponent.
upset_victory: Win against a team you previously lost to or a high-tier team.

🏆 Career Progression
career_stage: Based on match_index or year (e.g. "early career", "peak", "final season").
season_match_number: Match # in that season (already planned, but callout here for clarity).
was_senior_game: Final match of your career — maybe flag for extra sentiment.

🔄 Temporal + Historical Comparisons
season_avg_performance_score → attach rolling season average per match (good for "above/below avg" context).
vs_last_time_same_opponent → track if your performance improved or worsened from previous meeting with that team.
form_trend_label → tag match as "rising", "plateau", "decline" based on performance trend slope.

🪄 Contextual Superlatives
season_highs_flags:
most_kills_this_season
most_aces_this_season
most_blocks_this_season
(auto True if current value == season max)
record_breaker_flag → if you beat a personal best from any previous season

📣 Narrative Markers (for storytelling)
redemption_game → you played this team last season and lost, now you won.
clutch_performance_flag → big game (playoff/high importance) + high performance score (e.g. top 10%).
heartbreaker → high performance but close loss (e.g. margin_pct < 0.1, score > season average)
dominant_sweep → swept opponent + performance score in top 25%
momentum_swing → game that turned a losing streak into a winning streak

🧬 Skill Profile Analysis
Helps with scouting yourself:

offense_dominant_match → kills + aces contribute > 65% of your performance score.
defense_dominant_match → digs + blocks contribute > 65%.
balanced_match → No single stat group (offense, defense, service) > 50% of score.
low_error_game → combined kill_err + serve_err is below season median

🎮 “Sim-like” Potential Tags (for fun)
game_rating: Normalize performance to 0–100 scale (could mix performance + importance + result)
energy_boost_game: After match with fatigue_factor ≥ 0.8 → you still performed above avg
high_impact_win: Game you won with high personal performance and low margin (you were the difference-maker)

📚 Dataset Organization Helpers
data_quality_flag → “missing_stats”, “incomplete_sets”, “ambiguous_opponent” → for future cleaning awareness
